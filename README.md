Abstract:
	CMS stands for Content Management System. The definition of a CMS is an application (more likely web-based), that provides capabilities for multiple users with different permission levels to manage (all or a section of) content, data or information of a website project, or internet / intranet application. Managing content refers to creating, editing, archiving, publishing, collaborating on, reporting, distributing website content, data and information.

The Blog is a collection of links and tutorial from various websites which can help a novice programmer to become the master.
